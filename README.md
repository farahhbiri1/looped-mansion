# 🎮 Looped Mansion

A 2D mystery-horror puzzle game built with Godot 4.4.1.  
In a haunted mansion filled with secrets, you play as a character trapped in a time loop. Each death resets the game — but your memory persists. Your goal: survive, explore all paths, and uncover which friend is secretly a demon.
